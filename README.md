# Firebase Asynchronous Data Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked error in Firebase applications: attempting to use data from an asynchronous database operation before the data has actually been fetched. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file contains code that fetches user data from Firebase's Realtime Database. However, it attempts to use this data before the asynchronous operation has completed, resulting in the use of undefined values.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected code, utilizing Promises and `.then()` to handle the asynchronous data retrieval. This ensures the data is available before any operations that depend on it are executed.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have a Firebase project set up and the necessary credentials.
3. Replace the placeholder Firebase configuration with your own.
4. Run `bug.js`. Observe the error.
5. Run `bugSolution.js`. Observe the correct output.
